## Features

### **Computer Vision Tools**
1. **Image Classification**  
   Classify uploaded images into predefined categories using a ResNet-50 model.
   
2. **Text-to-Image Generation**  
   Generate images based on descriptive prompts using the FLUX model.

3. **Image-to-Text Captioning**  
   Generate descriptive captions for uploaded images using the BLIP model.

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools**
1. **Text Classification**  
   Classify text into emotional categories using the RoBERTa model.

2. **Text Summarization**  
   Summarize lengthy passages into concise summaries using the BART-large model.

3. **Text Generation**  
   Generate text based on a given prompt using the LLaMA model.

4. **Question Answering**  
   Answer questions based on a provided context using the RoBERTa SQuAD2 model.
